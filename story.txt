        The blustery cold of winter was fading quickly. Emma stepped outside
into the brisk air.
	Spring was coming.
	The cold, dark nights of winter were soon to be no longer, although the
mountains seem to not notice that the cold was slipping away. Snow blanketed
the giants rising up in the west. Emma took a few steps into the newness of
spring and breathed in giddily. It was finally time for an adventure.
