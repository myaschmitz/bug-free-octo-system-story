        The blustery cold of winter was fading quickly. Emma stepped outside
into the brisk air.
	Spring was coming.
	The cold, dark nights of winter were soon to be no longer, although the
mountains seem to not notice that the cold was slipping away. Snow blanketed
the giants rising up in the west. Emma took a few steps into the newness of
spring and breathed in giddily. It was finally time for an adventure.

Emma was so exicted for spring. It was her favorite season after all. Winter was so
harsh and unforgiving, but spring was quite the opposite. It was a time of happiness,
joy, and rebirth. She was ready to explore the outdoors and she wanted to start with the 
vast cornfield behind her house.

Emma saw same flowers outside her home and then she walked into the vast cornfield and then stayed there till the next mornning and it was a beautiful experience for her. 

The time in the corn field seems to be stagnant, and the brushing sound of the breeze blowing the corn leaves is also part of the stagnant time. The happiest ones in the corn field are those seven star ladybugs. They are the clocks, minutes and seconds that fly out of the stagnant time belt in the corn field. When they fly here and there, my spirit will follow them. They fly, and I fly too, happy and dizzy. The sky, the land, the air and the time are integrated at this time.
